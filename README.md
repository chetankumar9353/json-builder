# React App

This is a basic React application with all functionality removed.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.js` - Main application component
- `src/App.css` - Application styles
- `public/` - Static assets

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production

## Note

All JSON Builder functionality has been removed. This is now a clean React application ready for new development.
